# 2D-Shape-Extrusion-Manipulation

**Goal:** <br />
The goal is to create a Babylon.js application that allows the user to draw arbitrary 2D shapes on the ground plane, extrude them into 3D objects with a fixed height, and then manipulate those objects by moving the object and editing their vertices using buttons for mode selection.

**Features:** <br />
1. A 3D scene with a ground plane.
2. Functionality to allow the user to draw 2D shapes on the ground plane using mouse interactions <br />
                - left-click to add points <br />
                - right-click to complete the shape <br />
                - Draw button to enter the draw mode <br />
3. Extrude button to initiate the extrusion of 2D Closed loop polygons to a height of 5 units.
4. Move button to perform movement of extruded shapes on the ground plane
5. Edit button to edit the vertices of the extruded object using mouse interactions.
6. Visual cues and UI elements to indicate the selected object and active editing mode.

**How To run the application:**
1. Clone the repository to your local
2. Run the HTML file to view it on your web browser

**A glimpse into the Application:**
1. 3D scene with Ground plane
